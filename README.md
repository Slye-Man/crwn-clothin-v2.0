# React E-Commerce Project

This is a React-based e-commerce web application that allows users to browse through a catalog of products, add them to their cart, and complete the checkout process. This project demonstrates the use of various technologies including Routing with React Router, Authentication with Firebase, React Context for state management, observer pattern, firebase database storage, and CSS in JS with Styled-Components.
Getting Started

To get started with this project, first clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git>```

Once you have the repository cloned, navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

```npm install```

You will also need to set up a Firebase account and create a new project in the Firebase console. You should then create a .env file at the root of the project and add your Firebase configuration variables. Here's an example of what your .env file should look like:

```
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

With your Firebase configuration in place, you can then start the development server by running:

```npm start```
